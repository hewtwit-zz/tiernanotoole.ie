title: Building a Cross Compiler for your Raspberry Pi
---
My main machine at home, known as "The GodBox" is a Dual Processor, Quad Core Xeon 5520 with 60Gb RAM, 2 300Gb 10,000 RPM Hard drives in RAID 0 for boot, 4X1Tb 7200RPM drives for storage, 2 more 300Gb 10,000 RPM drives for "scratch disk" and a couple high(ish) end graphics cards with 3 monitors plugged in... Hence the name, GodBox! Anyway, The Raspberry Pi, on the other hand, has a 700Mhz processor, 256Mb RAM and not much else... So, if you need to write code for your Pi, and you dont want to wait a long time to compile, check out this tutorial on [how to build a cross compiler for your raspberry pi][1] which will allow you to build your apps on a different machine... I have a college project which the Raspberry Pi will be used for, and i am thinking this will be how i build code.
